# micropython-longwave
WAV player for MicroPython board

Uses double buffered approach to load chunks of samples.
Needs to be polled frequently so the chunks can be refreshed.

# Usage
from longwave import LongWave
lw = LongWave() # Default uses DAC1 and Timer4
lw.play('hisnibs.wav')

lw.play('hisnibs.wav', 120) # 120% speed

(Make sure you call lw.poll() at least every 100ms)
